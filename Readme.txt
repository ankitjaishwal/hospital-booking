Hey, I've used Redux to store dummy data. By patient login one can book appointment for available slots. And by hospital login one can see the bookings. Since, I'm using redux, reloading the page will wipe out data. So after booking just log out(from patient login) and do hospital login to see all the booked slots.

Patient Login Creds:-
  email:- patient1@gmail.com
  pass:- patient123
  
  email:- patient2@gmail.com
  pass:- patient123
  
Hospital Login Creds:-
  email:- hospital@gmail.com
  pass:- hospital123
  
  
Note: - I have just used limited slots from 10:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. (with a lunch break between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. So while booking, be sure to choose these slots.
